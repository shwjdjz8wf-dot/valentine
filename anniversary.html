        Happy 3 month anniversary, pretty monkey. Diti, I love you sooo much. Even though I’m nowhere near as perfect as you, you loved and cared for e so much. I love your laugh, I love your smile, actually I just love everything about you. I love playing our Minecraft world together, where we lose track of time because of how much fun we’re having and end up sleeping at 1 am. I love our silly jokes and our shared hatred of the nether, especially blazes and wither skeletons. (Hogs too, they’re almost as big a pain in the fucking ass) Thank you for just being you. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for always making me happy. Thank you for just everything you’ve ever done for me despite my imperfections. I love you so much, and I will always love you no matter what.You are my favourite person and the best person in my life. You are worth more than anything money could buy (im still buying u a gift btw) and I hope that I can have you in my future. I love you with all my heart and I hope that I Can make u as happy as you make me.
